# tictactoe
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! This is a classic two-player game implemented using the core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is simple, interactive, and fun to play, showcasing my skills in front-end development and logic implementation.
Features:
Two-Player Mode: Play against a friend on the same device.

Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Win Detection: The game automatically detects a win or a draw and displays the result.

Reset Game: Easily restart the game at any point with the reset button.

Clean and Intuitive UI: A minimalistic and user-friendly interface designed with CSS.

How to Play:
Open the game in your browser.

Player 1 uses X and Player 2 uses O.

Take turns clicking on the grid to place your symbol.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the game board and layout.

CSS: For styling and creating a visually appealing design.

JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, including win detection and turn management.

How to Run:
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Start playing!

Future Improvements:
Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.

Implement animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.

Add a score tracker for multiple rounds.
